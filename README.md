### Interview Sample Project

using creat-react-app and typescript

### Recap

I was given around 45 minutes to complete this challenge. While I wasn't able to finish it all on time, it was a great experience to code under pressure. I did my best to use proper naming conventions, functional components, styled-components, and modular structure despite it taking me more time.  
 
It took another hour and a half to finish the project on my own after the coding interview ended.  

Overall, it was a great learning experience! On to the next.
